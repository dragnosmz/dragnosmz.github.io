                <br>

				This is a personal blog. It seems suddenly that the years accelerate and move faster and faster. Time to switch speeds a little bit.

                By the way, here is one of my favorite lines from Hozier,
                <br>

                    <i>"I clutched my life<br>

                    How many years<br>

                Because all these things you're addicted to are hyper-stimulating your brain.

                You only need them because your standard for what entertains you is extremely high.

                People don't have the attention span anymore to just go out in the middle of nowhere and enjoy life.

			<h3><span>0x02</span> &mdash; <i>a love letter to forums</i></h3>
			<p>
                Time goes on, technology is innovated upon, however when I was younger, I used to be enthralled through forums.
                <br>  
                I don’t understand the particulars of it, but there’s something oddly satisfying about creating a post on a board, and having to take a seat and refresh the page numerous times until you get a response.  
                <br>
                <br>
                That’s something these days' technology has taken from us.
                <br>  
                Why would people need to sit on a forum, create a submission asking how to fix a problem or spark some kind of conversation while they could go on Discord and get a response damn close to instantly?
                <br>
                <br>
                Name it what you want, patience, delayed gratification–regardless of the case may be, forums have a certain charm to them.
                <br>
                And even as I respect a very good quick reaction every so often, or a brief catch-up conversation with old buddies over instant messaging,  
                I have a huge appreciation for simple forums.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the forum community, it’s difficult to attract human beings in. It’s difficult to entice people to sign up for in on something so primitive and previous.
                <br>
                Perhaps I just stay in the past, but even nowadays I still slay bits and bytes on good old bulletin boards.
                <br>
                <br>
                And, if you look hard enough, you would possibly even discover forums that I’m still an active keyboard warrior on.

			<h3><span>0x01</span> &mdash; <i>systemdo or systemdon't</i></h3>
			<p>
                Often times in the Linux community, people will tell you things like “systemd is terrible” and that you shouldn’t use it.
                <br>
                Then they will go on a triad of reasons why systemd is awful.
                <br>
                Now, to any normal or knowledgeable user, some of these arguments in opposition to systemd can be considered valid.
                <br>
				<br>
                But to any other person, specially users new to Linux, these are horribly deceptive reasons to use something apart from systemd.
                <br>
                <br>
                The latter crowd is who this blog entry is for.
                <br>
                <br>
                Systemd calls itself a “software suite”. So, as such, it offers many tools–few of that are actually simple–which are useful within the runtime of the operating system.
                <br>
                None of systemd’s components are inherently bad.
                <br>
                The trouble with systemd is that the entirety of the suite is performed as pid 1.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first process is the one that on many systems is the init system. It is the highest parent system in the hierarchy, as it is carried out by the kernel.
                <br>
                Now in a few programs, this is what you may want. You may want a reliable and battle tested process running as the init, especially on servers.
                <br>
                You may even need it on a computer as nicely, for ease of use
                <br>
                The biggest problem with being informed what init to use and what no longer to apply is that what works for others may not give you the results you want. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A lot of people have asked me what init they should use. The handiest answer,   use the one that works. If systemd works in your machine, why replace it? 
                <br>
                <br>
                On top of that, a few distributions of Linux almost hard depend on systemd. for example, <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> , where the complete system is constructed on the premise of using systemd. packages which are installed have appropiate unit files for systemd. replacing it, while it can be done,
			    <br>
                is a tidious and quite disturbing process.
                <br>
                <br>
                So all of this is to say: if you’re the person who is new to linux, and also you don’t know what init to use, don’t trade your init at all.
                <br>
                To quote a friend of mine, <i>Linux users are all about freedom of choice, right up until someone's choice differs from theirs.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                And on the alternative aspect of the spectrum, if you’re the redbilled based user who is preaching to the newer, pure linux customers:
                <br>
                *Shut up*. let them analyze the pros or cons of the software themselves. after all, for as much as I dislike systemd myself, <i>it just works</i>.
