        So this is my "blog" of sorts. A little about me, about the work I do, my system, etc.
        <br>
            This isn't strictly tech related. This is just a blog for me to write whatever comes to my mind and write about things that I find interesting.
        <br>
        Also, I'm real bad at spelling, so you'll just have to overlook my mistakes.
        <br>

        My name is Senath Methsuka. I am a student from Sri Lanka, who loves Linux. I believe strongly in the adoption of FOSS. I prefer simplicity and functionality over flash and bloat
